Use case
--------
An average family just got their first Linux computer set up by a friend
of the elder son, Tom. Tom was able to convince his father to save some
bucks on the operating system but spending it for a faster video card:-)

Tom has been instructed by his friend how to install packages. And so he is
given the order to setup up "that backup stuff we use at office". His father
is sure Tom will eventually wipe out all his important emails...

So Tom looks for some backup tool and finds isibackup in the Debian distribution
He installs it and wants to get some information about what to do next. He
doesn't want to read manuals or to answer a thousand questions. He just wants
to show his father that he followed order and continue playing Tuxracer.

The family has one computer that has a connection to the internet. It also has a
CD-Burner and a reasonable big hard disk (let's say 60GB). Backup is a small
concern, so not much time will be invested. But reasonable current versions of
files the family created should be on backed up somewhere.

Noone will think about creating CDs. There need to be some notice, when a backup
is necessary. An email should be sent to the father and Tom at the end of the
month saying a new CD has to be created. The creation should be startable
with only a few clicks or commands.

On day, Toms mother

There should be some possibility for Tom to help his mother when she
wants to get an old file.

Tom doesn't know about full and differential backup strategies. And he doesn't want
to. He allways wants to have access to all the available files.
