Template: isibackup/backup_root
Type: string
Default: /var/backups/isibackup
Description: Directory the backups get stored to:
 ISiBackup needs a directory, where all the backups are stored to.
 /var/backups/isibackup is generally a good idea.
 Assure the directory exists if you choose your own.

Template: isibackup/opt_packmethod
Type: select
Choices: cpio.bz2
Default: cpio.bz2

Template: isibackup/crypt_keys
Type: string
Default: Backup
Description: Idents of GnuPG public keys used for encrypting backups:
 In order to encrypt your backups you must specify the ident of a PGP/gpg key to use.
 You can specify multiple keys separated by semicolon.
 It is sufficient to specify only a part of the identifier. The key looked up
 with PGP's own method. So have a look into it's manuals to get more information.
 You need to import and validate this correctly by yourself.
