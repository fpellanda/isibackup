# This is a configuration file for ISiBackup. It is extensivly commented.
# If you configure ISiBackup the first time, you probably want to read through
# this file, and change one thing after the other.
#
# Target Audience: First time user; Desktop user
#
# Most defaults do make sense, and nothing bad happens if you don't change them.
# But to have a working backup system that really does help you, you will need to
# invest some time.
#
# Don't worry, you don't have to read everything in here. There are only about 5
# settings you have to set. A setting is a simple line of the form
# NAME="Some Value" that has no leading #.
#
# Every setting is extensivly commented. The comments get increasingly specific.
# As soon as you stop understanding, you probably don't profit from further
# reading. Skip to the next setting.

# If you've read this already too many times, here's a trick:
#  grep -C1 '^[^#].*=' THISFILE.conf | grep -v -- '--' | grep -v '^#[[:space:]]*$'


# File format:
CMD_PACK=tar.gz

# Different file formats can be used for the archive.
# Which file formats is best depends on your needs. But tar.gz is normaly
# a good choice.
#
# Here is a quick overview of the supported formats:
# tar.gz
# ------
#   Use this is if you don't care.
#   Normally, this is a good choice for use under Linux and other
#   Unix-like operating systems.
#   File permissions and ownerships are preserved.
#
# zip
# ---
#   Use this if you want to access the archive in a Windows environment.
#   You need to have the zip and unzip programs installed. ISiBackup will
#   tell you on the first use if you need to install this package.
#   File permissions and ownerships are preserved.
#
# tar.bz2
# -------
#   Use this if you want to spend time for space.
#   Similar to tar.gz, but slower. It has better compression
#   than tar.gz.
#
# rar
# ---
#   Use this if you like rar.
#   Don't know about permissions and ownership... Rar is often used to pack
#   MP3 albums.
#   This program is nonfree in respect to the Debian policy. We suggest to
#   use one of the other formats.
#
# cpio.gz
# -------
#   Use this if you want to backup system or special files.
#   If you want to backup files from /dev or other system files like named
#   pipes, you should choose cpio. It can be combinied with other package formats
#   like cpio.zip, cpio.bz2 or plain cpio.

# Path to archive:
BACKUP_ROOT=/var/backups/isibackup

# You need to specify a place where the backups are stored.
#
# The default is normaly fine. With this setting, all the backups are saved in
# /var/backups/isibackup. Browse this directory to find files in your archive.
#
# You need to make sure there's enough space left on the hard disk. Full Backups
# can get quite big, calculate abot two thirds of the size of the files you
# want to backup.
#
# There are a few common strategies, where to save the backups:
#
# Local hard drive
# ----------------
#   Use this if you have only one hard disk.
#   When you back up to the same hard disk, you work on, it is possible that you lose
#   both your original data and the backup at once. While it doesn't help you when the
#   disk brakes, local backup is better than nothing.
#
#   /var/backups contains some backups of system files. It is a good practice to save
#   the ISiBackup archive to this directory too. By default the backups done with ISiBackup
#   go to /var/backups/isibackup.
#
#   Samples:
#   BACKUP_ROOT=/var/backups/isibackup # [Default] Backup to system backup directory
#
#   BACKUP_ROOT=/home/backup # Backup to home directory of dedicated backup user
#
#
# Second hard drive
# -----------------
#   Use this if you want to have the backups on another disk.
#   This gives you some more safety in case of a hard disk breakdown. It is highly unlikely
#   that both the backup and original disk break at once.
#
#   You need to mount the hard drive you want to put your backup on. The mount must
#   be read/write.
#
#   Samples:
#   The following samples assume you have mounted
#   /dev/hdb1 to /mnt/hdb1 and /dev/sda1 to /mnt/sda1 (see 'man mount' to learn more).
#
#   BACKUP_ROOT=/mnt/hdb1 # Backup to the root of the first partition on the second
#                           IDE hard disk.
#
#   BACKUP_ROOT=/mnt/sda1/isibackup # Backup to directory 'isibackup' on the first partition
#                                     of the first scsi disk.
#
# CD/DVD Backup
# -------------
#   Use this if you want a physical copy.
#   If you're office is flooded, or your computer caught fire, you'll be happy to have at
#   least some data on CDs. CD Backup is not an everyday thing. But once a month is good
#   practice.
#
#   To be on the save side, store the backup CDs (or copies of them) at a different location.
#   The worst place is on top of the computer we made a backup of. The best one is a safe of
#   a swiss bank:-)
#
#   CD burning after a full backup can be a painfull task. Todays harddisks can be well
#   above 100GB, a CD only has some 700MB. You'll get away with less disks but higher prices
#   when using writable DVDs.
#
#   The current version of ISiBackup is not quite ready for CD backup, yet. But you can simply
#   burn the archive created by ISiBackup to CDs.
#
#   There are different ways to put your backup on CD:
#    - Use your favorite burning tool like K3b or CDBakeoven to burn the archive directory.
#    - Use mkisofs and cdrecord to burn the archive directory.
#
#   You have to be aware, that the archive will be probably bigger than one CD. You have to take
#   care of the splitting between volumes yourself. This will be changed in future versions.

# Path to full backups
PATH_FULL=/var/backups/isibackup/full/$DATE

# This is the path where full backups are saved.
#

# Path to differential backups
PATH_DIFF=/var/backups/isibackup/diff/$DATE



# Path to log files
LOG_DIR=/var/log/isibackup

# Have a look into this directory, if you want to see what ISiBackup is doing.
# ISiBackup logs all the things it does into files in this directory.
#
# ISiBackup keeps the last 10 logs of every kind. The logs are rotated weekly.
# If a log gets bigger than 1MB the log gets rotated. Older logs get compressed.
#
# The program logrotate is used to do this. You can set how many logs you want
# to have, how big they can get, tell logrotate to mail the logs to you and
# more.
#
# You can tweak the way logrotate handles your logs by changing the file
# /etc/logrotate.d/isibackup. The manpage of logrotate gives you more
# information how to do this.


# There is more to learn about ISiBackups additional features like backup in
# networks, or enhanced security for your archived files.
#
# There are dedicated sample configurations for the following features and
# backup strategies:
#
# example-crypt.conf
# example-backup-server.conf
# example-cd.conf
# example-system.conf
