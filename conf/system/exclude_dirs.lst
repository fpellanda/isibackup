# list of directories to be excluded from backup
#
# please be aware that these are egrep patterns, not shell patterns!
# default (if no line here): no directory excluded
# exclude /var/home if we have /home
# exlude various locally- and dynamically-generated files
# from kernel sources, just backup top directory (containting .config)
#
# we should exclude everything from data, config and volatile
# so if you include something here, be sure to exclude it in the data or config backup
