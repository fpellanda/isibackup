# list of directories to be included in backup
#
# please be aware that these are shell patterns, not egrep patterns! 
# they will be used as input for the find command
# default (if no line here): no directory included!
# do escape all spaces with a backslah
# do not use expansions and spaces on the same line
# links are stored as links and are not followed, so if you include /var here, and it points to /usr/var, that is not being backuped! 
# you would have to include /usr/var then instead of /var. the same is true for the exclude lists.
