installation note

be aware that there might be such subtle things as volumes mounted with wrong parameters (once I erroneously mounted an ntfs volume with codepage cp850 instead of utf8; and setting permissions on a samba share does not work (neither on nfs) so usage of the corresponding flags is needed, and you must alway<s be aware of samba incompatibilities, especially between 2.3 and 2.999 (both on linux!))

in order to use encryption, you must use a crypter that supports encryption of files. this is _not_ the case for the gnupg 1.0.6 which is part of the standard woody distribuition. you need at least gnupg 1.0.7, which is part of sarge.

further on, in order to use encryption, you need a public key to encrypt to. but first of all, you need an ultimately trusted key pair on your system. to generate that, use 
  gpg --gen-key
afterwards you have at least one key you trust ultimately. 
of course, you may import an already trusted key pair from a file. use
  gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import <keyfile>
although that second option is marked obsolete, gpg 1.0.7 requires it.
you must trust this imported key ultimately by setting 
  gpg --edit-key "imported key"
    trust
      5- ultimate

normally, the key for which you cxrypt your backup will be the "Backup Public Key", which you distribute to your system and then import using 
  gpg --import-keys <filename>
but that doesn't suffice, as gpg requires you to indicate which key you trust before you may use them. so trust the key by signing it with
  pgp --sign-key "Backup"  (or whatever you called it)
